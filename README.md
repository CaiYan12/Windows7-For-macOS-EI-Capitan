"MyFinder" is a software developed by domestic developers to simulate the top bar of the MacOS desktop, which is highly imitative. Using the MyDock developed by the author, the desktop is almost identical to the MacOS desktop. (The software should be in the development and improvement phase. There may be minor problems during use. It is recommended that you always pay attention to the author's network disk to get the latest version.)
“MyDock"A software developed by a domestic developer to simulate the bottom Dock of the MacOS desktop can realize the dynamic effect of minimizing the window to the Dock, and even emulating the interface of the Lunchpad that comes with MacOS. It can be said that the simulation is in place. It is recommended that you try. (The software should be in the stage of development and perfection. There may be minor problems in the process of use. It is recommended that you always pay attention to the author's network disk to get the latest version.)
Since the window styles of macOS Sierra and the new macOS High Sierra system are not different from the window styles of Yosemite and EL Capitan, I have not made any new themes. Here, the default wallpaper of the new system is extracted and provided for everyone to use.

From Yosemite, the interface style change of OS X is still quite large compared with the previous ones. The system icons also have no small changes, and tend to be flatter and more colorful, and the new interface effect is very good. Here, I extracted all the .icns icon files of the Yosemite 10.10.1 system and some application software icons. About 1,400 icons, PNG version conversion icons and Iconpackager5 icon packages have been released. Welcome to use. The icon pack is for everyone to study and use for desktop simulation. Do not use it for other purposes. Extract the package decompression password: nickzone.(In addition, Win7 requires the Iconpackager software to replace the system icon, which needs to be installed separately to load the icon package.)

One of the features of OS X is the Dock at the bottom, similar to the Windows taskbar, but more beautiful and sophisticated, the essential element for simulating the OS X desktop is the Dock. At present, the Dock simulation software that can achieve a transparent matte effect is the Object Dock, so the Yosemite Dock skin is made for it. Although it is not 100% consistent, it is very similar. It is recommended for everyone to use.
